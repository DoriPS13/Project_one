# Ramen Hunter

Ramen Hunter is an app to search for ramen by either geolocation or user input location.


## Overview

I have always had trouble looking for ramen on yelp. I decided to make this app to help search for ramen based on a menu items. The basic functionality is done by the Locu API menu search and HTML 5 geolocation feature, with javascript to grab the users location onload.
